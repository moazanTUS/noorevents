## Our Inspiration
Due to the lack of a viable Islamic event management websites in Ireland. We decided to fill the void by building one ourselves to help the community.

## About
**NoorEvents** is a web-based event platform focusing on islamic events within Ireland. Our goal is to fill a void that is currently present relating to the organization and availability of islamic events in Ireland. By using our platform, organizers and attendees alike can experience a headache free experience. For organizers, NoorEvents aids in automating the process of event management by viewing an automated nationwide overview of islamic events, therefore avioding issues such as overlap. For attendees, a clean user friendly interface allows you to view all events on a map view, calender and containers. 

## Tech Stack
* React
* TypeScript
* CSS
* Leaflet

## Challenges
Implementing Google maps API was an issue that we weren't able to figure out, but eventually we decided to go with a different and open-source map interface called Leaflet.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

## Accomplishments
Attending a hackathon in and of itself was an accomplishment in our opinion. But we're really proud of the fact that we finished the project within the time limit and got almost all functionality done. The interface as well has been a pleasure to work on and we're proud of what we have achieved.
What we learned

## Lessons Learnt
We learnt about prompt engineering, teamwork, and web scraping as well as much, much more.
What's next for NoorEvents (Islamic Events)

## What's Next?!
We're going to international Inshallah. But before we get ahead of ourselves, we'd like to polish our backend and add more features and functionality in the following weeks. After that is said and done we'd then like to expand to the international market, to the UK and beyond.
